*This* is my first post!

It is written in
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
with kramdown.

<span id="blinker">
  But now we're in an HTML span, the text color changing randomly with JS.
</span>

<script>
  var el = document.getElementById("blinker");
  var i;
  var colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "purple", "pink", "orange"];

  setInterval(function() {
    i = Math.round(Math.random() * (colors.length - 1));
    el.style.color = colors[i];
  }, 500);
</script>
